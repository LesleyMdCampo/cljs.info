Keeping a record of design decisions to be compiled into an infographic later.

Open Sans (weights 300, 400, 600) was chosen for its clean appearance and
excellent legibility. Droid Sans Mono was chosen as a compliment pair for
monospaced code.  Both typefaces have a neutral appearance and keep the focus on
the content, not the type.

Font differentiation is used to distinguish between groups headers, section
headers, row labels, and table symbols. Each has a distinct appearance and can
be recognized at a glance.

Info tooltips provide context and additional information helpful to developers
coming from other languages. Comparisons to JavaScript are mentioned as
relevant.

Tooltips are unobstrusive unless hovered over. Grey is used to make them
visually "wash over" when not needed.

Tables contain no additional marks other than labels and content. Color is used
to separate table rows.

High contrast colors are used to ensure legibility on a wide range of devices
and screens.

Where appropriate, section headers contain the literal representation or
shorthand version of their form. Users already familiar with the literal forms
will instantly recognize their connection to the section. Users unfamiliar with
the literal forms may be confused at first, but should eventually have an "aha!"
moment when they make the connection. This is my favorite feature of the
cheatsheet due to the unique relationship that LISP code has to its visual
structure.
