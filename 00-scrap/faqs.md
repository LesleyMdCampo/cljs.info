## Can I use jQuery with ClojureScript?

Absolutely! You can use any JavaScript library from ClojureScript. Check out
Examples 1000 and 1001 and read about JavaScript Interop for more information.

## Is ClojureScript a good fit for a single-page application (SPA)?

Yes, very much so. Dead code removal, namespace + package management, etc. You
get a lot of stuff baked into the language that otherwise has to be accomplished
with libraries or conventions in JS.

## What is the relationship between Clojure and ClojureScript? Are they the same thing?

TODO: write me

## Why does ClojureScript require the JVM / Java? I thought this was a JavaScript thing.

ClojureScript *is* a JavaScript thing.

## What is Leiningen? Why do I need this for ClojureScript?

TODO: write me

## What is `project.clj`?

`project.clj` is a Leiningen project file. If you are familiar with common
node.js conventions, `project.clj` acts like a combination of `package.json` and
`Gruntfile.js`. TODO: need more language comparisons here
