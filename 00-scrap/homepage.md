These are marketing blurbs that can be used on the homepage as a very quick
introduction to some of the the language's best selling points. Note that these
are not in order right now.



# Built-in Code Organization

ClojureScript has namespace and package management support built directly into
the language. No more depending on an external library and getting everyone on
your team to follow the same conventions. It just works.

# Whole Program Optimization

ClojureScript leverages the Google Closure Compiler in Advanced Optimizations
mode to allow for automatic removal of dead code. Add as much code to your
ClojureScript project as you need and the end result will always be as small as
possible.

# Unrivaled Syntax Power

Say goodbye to boilerplate code with macros. ClojureScript is a LISP and allows
for programmatic access to the syntax of the language at the lowest level. This
unique feature allows you to write powerful libraries and extend the language
exactly as your program requires.

# Sane approach to state

By default, all data in ClojureScript is immutable so you never have to worry
about the value of something at one time vs another. When the situation calls
for mutability, ClojureScript distinguishes between setting and retrieving
values, making state far easier to reason about.

# 100% JavaScript

Use any JavaScript library from ClojureScript. Write a ClojureScript library to
be used by JavaScript. 100% compatibility; no exceptions.

# You're in good hands

The ClojureScript community is part of the broader Clojure community, a popular
language that runs on the JVM. Clojure programmers are known for being fun,
helpful, and very smart. We're glad you're here.
