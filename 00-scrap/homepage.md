Things needed on the homepage:

* Jumbotron text: "JavaScript made simple" (alt: JavaScript, meet Simple)
* current stable version + date (ie: show that CLJS is being actively maintained)
* marketing blurbs + code samples (where appropriate)
* highlight some of the more common FAQs, link to them
* companies using CLJS
* CLJS is free and open source (link to license and GitHub page)

This blurb should be below the Jumbotron text:

_ClojureScript is a functional programming language that targets JavaScript. It
comes with a rich set of data types, an extensive core library, and a novel
approach to state. Programming for the browser\* will never be the same._

_\* ClojureScript also works with node.js_

These are marketing blurbs that can be used on the homepage as a very quick
introduction to some of the the language's best selling points.

### 100% JavaScript

Use any JavaScript library from ClojureScript. Write a ClojureScript library to
be used by JavaScript. 100% compatibility; no exceptions.

### Built-in Code Organization

Namespace and package management support are built directly into the
ClojureScript language. No more depending on an external library and getting
everyone on your team to follow the same conventions. It just works.

### Whole Program Optimization

ClojureScript uses the Google Closure Compiler in Advanced Optimizations mode to
automatically remove dead code. Add as much code to your ClojureScript project
as needed. The end result will always be as small as possible.

### Sane approach to state

Reasoning about state is simple in ClojureScript. All data is immutable by
default, so you never have to worry about the value of something at one time vs
another. When mutability is needed, ClojureScript distinguishes between setting
and retrieving values so it's easy to keep track of what's going on in your
program.

### Unrivaled Syntax Power

Say goodbye to boilerplate code with macros! ClojureScript is a LISP and allows
for programmatic access to its syntax at the lowest level. Write powerful
libraries and extend the language exactly as your program requires.

### You're in good hands

The ClojureScript community is part of the broader Clojure community, a popular
language that runs on the JVM. Clojure programmers are known for being fun,
helpful, and very smart. We're glad you're here.
